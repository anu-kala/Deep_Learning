I recently developed a Cybersecurity Attack Detection model using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to classify network activity as malicious or safe. The project involved data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, applying one-hot transformation, and standardizing inputs before training an Artificial Neural Network for binary classification. The model analyzes indicators such as packet size, login attempts, session duration, encryption usage, and IP reputation to estimate attack probability, achieving an accuracy of 87% on evaluation data. This experience strengthened my understanding of end-to-end ML pipelines — from feature engineering and model training to performance evaluation using confusion matrices — and enhanced my practical skills in applying deep learning techniques to real-world cybersecurity problems.
